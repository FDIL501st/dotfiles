This is my configs backup.

Purpose is to make my life easier when I change machines or install a linux distro.


#### Current script errors I get

```
stow: ERROR: The stow directory dotfiles does not contain package install.sh
HEAD is now at 6ce1d1f Still attempting to have stow ignore the install.sh.
fatal: destination path '/home/fdil/.config/tmux/plugins/tpm' already exists and is not an empty directory.
fatal: destination path '/home/fdil/.config/tmux/plugins/catppuccin/tmux' already exists and is not an empty directory.
```

That is the bash output from the script.

Though errors exist, at the moment, didn't find issues with installation and symlinks.
